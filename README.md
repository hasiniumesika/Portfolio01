# Portfolio — Hasini Umesika

This is a simple static portfolio template created for Hasini Umesika. It includes a hero, an MLT-focused About section, Projects and Contact sections.

How to use:
- Open `index.html` in the browser to preview.
- Edit `index.html` to change content.
- Add projects by calling the `addProject` function in `js/script.js` or by editing the markup.

Added content:
- Education, Relevant course, Skills and Certifications in the About section
- Two sample projects (EEG Project, Portfolio Website) in Projects

Recent changes:
- Converted the site to a **mobile-first** design (base styles for small screens with min-width breakpoints for larger screens).
- Improved mobile navigation accessibility: the menu toggle uses `aria-expanded` and the menu closes after tapping a link.
 - Downloaded your Imgur image and stored it locally at `images/profile.jpg`. The hero now uses this local profile image and centers it on mobile.

Next steps:
- Provide your project details (title, description, link) and I will add them.
- Tell me if you prefer a different color scheme or want me to convert this to React/Vite.
 - Tell me if you prefer a different color scheme or want me to convert this to React/Vite.

Deployment:
- You can deploy this as static site on Netlify or GitHub Pages.
